        <p>For years Omaha and the surrounding markets have felt the drive-in drought.  After the last theater closed in Council Bluffs the community was left with a void.  Facebook pages were born and many people talked about the idea of opening up a new place to host this long-time favorite cinema experience.  Falconwood Park heard your voices and opened up the first drive-in movie theater this area has seen in over a decade!</p>

        <p>Our first summer series was immensely popular prompting sellouts for most movies.  We were greatly humbled and hope to see your continued support of this venture so we can keep the format alive for years to come!  This year we are back and better than ever applying much of what we learned to provide you with the most authentic experience!</p>

              <h1 class="yellow text-center p-t-5 accent-font-1">Ticket Info</h1>

              <ul class="yellow text-center p-t-5 p-b-5 accent-font-2">
                <li>Single Passenger - $7 per vehicle</li>
                <li>Two Passengers - $14 per vehicle</li>
                <li>Three or More Passengers - $20 per vehicle</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Falconwood Park does sell drive-in tickets at the gate, however, we <em>strongly</em> recommend purchasing your tickets ahead of time online as drive-in spots are limited and do quite frequently sell out.  Online ticket sales for each show will end an hour before gates open. Tickets for our drive-in are priced per vehicle and are based on occupancy.</p>

              <p>All movies start at dusk with the gates opening 2 hours prior.  Times will be posted on each individual film.</p>

              <h3 class="yellow text-center p-t-5 accent-font-2">Drive-In Passes</h3>

              <p>A Drive-In pass is guaranteed a drive-in parking spot.  150 Drive-in spots are available. Spots are filled on a first come first serve basis.</p>

              <h3 class="yellow text-center p-t-5 accent-font-2">Park and Walk Passes</h3>

              <p>Once the drive-in spots have been filled we have additional ticketing called a Park and Walk. Park and Walk patrons will park in a separate lot and are encouraged to bring blankets or chairs up to the viewing area in front of the screen to view the movie or meet up with your friends at their car. If you are getting tickets at the gate we suggest that you bring seating just in case we sell out of drive-in spots.</p>

              <h3 class="yellow text-center p-t-5 accent-font-2">Tent Passes</h3>

              <p>In addition to your Drive-In or Park and Walk pass, if you would like to camp after the show, you may purchase a tent pass for an extra $10 charge per tent.</p>

              <h1 class="yellow text-center p-t-5 accent-font-1">Concessions</h1>

              <p>Food trucks, a bar, and concessions are available at the venue and we encourage your patronage! No outside alcohol is allowed inside the park.</p>

              <h1 class="yellow text-center p-t-5 accent-font-1">FAQs</h1>

              <p><span class="yellow">Can I bring my own food?</span><br>Yes, we do offer food from our food trucks and concessions but feel free to pack a cooler and bring in any other munchies your tummy desires.</p>

              <p><span class="yellow">What time should we show up for a good drive-in spot?</span><br>Plan on showing up when the gates open for the best drive-in spot.  If you arrive before the gates open you will be asked to wait until the designated time for us to park you.</p>

              <p><span class="yellow">What time should we come if we're going to camp after the movie?</span><br>Just make sure you get here early enough to set up your campsite before the movie starts.</p>

He moves to Paris to follow his dream, and with the help of hapless garbage boy Linguini he puts his culinary skills to the test in the kitchen but he has to stay in hiding at the same time, with hilarious consequences. Remy eventually gets the chance to prove his culinary abilities to a great food critic but is the food good? A Pixar animation.</p>

                  <p class="m-t-10 m-l-5">Once upon a time, in a far away swamp, there lived an ogre named Shrek (Mike Myers) whose precious solitude is suddenly shattered by an invasion of annoying fairy tale characters. They were all banished from their kingdom by the evil Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow). Determined to save their home -- not to mention his -- Shrek cuts a deal with Farquaad and sets out to rescue Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) to be Farquaad's bride. Rescuing the Princess may be small compared to her deep, dark secret.</p>

Afterward, the ghosts of great players start emerging from the crops to play ball, led by "Shoeless" Joe Jackson. But, as Ray learns, this field of dreams is about much more than bringing former baseball greats out to play.</p>

This leads him to renowned driller Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis), who agrees to helm the dangerous space mission provided he can bring along his own hotshot crew. Among them is the cocksure A.J. (Ben Affleck), who Harry thinks isn't good enough for his daughter (Liv Tyler), until the mission proves otherwise.</p>

                  <p class="m-t-10 m-l-5"><span class="yellow text-center accent-font-2">Men In Black: </span>They are the best-kept secret in the universe. Working for a highly funded yet unofficial government agency, Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) and Jay (Will Smith) are the Men in Black, providers of immigration services and regulators of all things alien on Earth. While investigating a series of unregistered close encounters, the MIB agents uncover the deadly plot of an intergalactic terrorist who is on a mission to assassinate two ambassadors from opposing galaxies currently in residence in New York City.</p>
